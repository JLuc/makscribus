# maksvn script creates folders for out of source build 
# has command line options for really clean build, creating diffs and for svn update
# has various inline options to EDIT to fit your environnement	
#
# Sourcepath, qt library and destination folders can be set to user conveninence
# but sourcepath will later contain both the 'svn' subfolder and the 'build' subfolder
# ('svn' receives svn repo clone, 'build' receive build objects)
