makscribus
==========

Scripts to make and install scribus

- maksvn : update to trunk svn head and make scribus 1.5
- makgit : update to some branch of the contributors GIT repo's head and make scribus 1.5 version for that branch - out of order due to lack of activity on the contributor's repo

Works on Ubuntu 13.10

Todo
----

* add il8n functionality (translate the script prompts to other languages) [[Discussion]](https://github.com/JLuc/makscribus/issues/2)
* offer other linux 'flavor' options...(involves mostly fine-tuning library installs)
* preliminary checks to see if svn + gcc + cmake etc packages are installed
* init the svn checkout
