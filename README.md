makscribus
==========

Scripts to make and install scribus

- maksvn : update to trunk svn head and make scribus 1.5
- makgit : update to some branch of the contributors GIT repo's head and make scribus 1.5 version for that branch - out of order due to lack of activity on the contributor's repo

Works on Ubuntu 13.10
